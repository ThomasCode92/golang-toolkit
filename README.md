# Golang Toolkit

This repository contains my journey of learning the Go programming language. It
includes small projects that focus on specific language features and larger
projects that are more "_real-world_".

## 📁 Structure

```bash
golang-toolkit/
├── concepts/   # Small, focused Go learning projects
├── projects/   # Larger, real-world style applications
└── scripts/    # Helper scripts for various tasks
```

## 🚀 Running Projects

Each folder in `concepts/` or `projects/` is a standalone Go module. **Use the
helper script**:

```bash
./scripts/run.sh <path-to-project>
```

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Bash (for scripts)](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 📘 Learning Topics

### Concepts
